				<project name="Maths Project Fermat's Little Theorem">Mathematics project on Fermatâ€™s little theorem and public key cryptography. Role was to create a bit of code to perform the primality test to be used during the presentation. Used Python to code the primality test. Presented the test during the presentation with audience participation. </project>
				<project name="Physics Project Quantum Mechanics">Physics project on using C++ for Quantum mechanics calculations. Worked with a supervisor to make an operation in quantum mechanics as efficient as possible given very large data sets. Performing the diagonalising operation on matrices of randomly generated gaussian numbers. Analysing how the computation time changes with the matrix size</project>
				<project name="Physics Project Johnson Noise">Physics project on Johnson Noise Worked with a supervisor to conduct an experiment on Johnson Noise. Used UNIX and the shell to run the experiment using a large data set. Learnt about the command line for the first time</project>
