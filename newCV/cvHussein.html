    													Garage Booking Management System<br>
														<mark>
    													For my Software Engineering module I participated in a Group Project with 4 fellow students who I had not known previously. Our task was to produce a Garage Managing Information System that would present an integrated graphical user interface of the following modules: Customer Accounts, Vehicle Records, Diagnostic &amp; Repair Bookings, Parts Record, Scheduled Maintenance Bookings and Specialist Repairs. My main responsibility was to produce the Scheduled Maintenance Bookings system where the admin would book a customer for either MoT and Usage/Time Based Servicing. Overall, We worked as a cohesive team and I believe that this was the difference-maker in helping us achieve a high grade in our project.<br> <br>
