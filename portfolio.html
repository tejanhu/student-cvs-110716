SecureSwipe (Individual)<br> </summary>
<p>
For my dissertation I was tasked to produce an android application using Android Studio that would put in place a unique locking system to allow users to securely unlock their devices through swiping images. This required me to perform and validate a lot of functional testing such as Black box testing and White box testing.<br></p>

I love travelling, thus I was inspired to build a Flight RESTful API through Django's Rest Framework that would allow API clients to navigate through Flight information i.e.: pilots, flight origin and destination.<br></p>

Garage Booking Management System<br></summary>
<p>
For my Software Engineering module I participated in a Group Project with 4 fellow students who I hadnâ€™t known previously. Our task was to produce a Garage Managing Information System that would present an integrated graphical user interface of the following modules: Customer Accounts, Vehicle Records, Diagnostic & Repair Bookings, Parts Record, Scheduled Maintenance Bookings and Specialist Repairs. My main responsibility was to produce the Scheduled Maintenance Bookings system where the admin would book a customer for either MoT and Usage/Time Based Servicing. Overall, We worked as a cohesive team and I believe that this was the difference-maker in helping us achieve a high grade in our project.<br></p>
